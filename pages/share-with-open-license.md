## License and Accessibility Check

Be sure your work is eligible to be shared. In order to release your work with a Creative Commons
license or in the public domain, your work should be cleared from all copyright issues. Your open
content can include:

1.  Content that you created yourself that has an
[open license]({{ "/pages/license-features" | relative_url }}) on it; and
2.  Content that someone else created that has an open license on it (or is in the
[public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)).

Where you are using other content, is your use allowed? Did you include an
[attribution]({{ "/pages/attributions" | relative_url }}) back to the original? Did you add an
open license to all of your own content?

Hopefully, you considered good [accessibility]({{ "/pages/accessible" | relative_url }}) practices
from the beginning. Consider doing a final accessibility check and improve your materials where
possible. A few very basic practices that should become habits:

- Images have alt tags
- Video is captioned
- PDF's are machine readable
- Document structures use headings to support navigation by screen readers
- Links are anchored to descriptive text rather than the word "here"

## Ready to Share

Next, you will need to host your file or files in an online place accessible to others. Consider
uploading your files to Google Drive (be sure to make the files viewable to the public and give
multiple people "owner" roles) or upload and host them to another publicly available platform.

After hosting your files, contribute them to OER repositories. We recommend:

-   [Open Textbook Library](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/) - if your material is in the
format of a complete book
-   [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/) - submit here regardless of the format of your
materials; you'll need to create an account
-   [Open Oregon Resources page](http://openoregon.org/resources/) - Oregon faculty post here to
let others know what they are using and whether they can be contacted about their course.

Remember to share locally as well: email your department chairs, deans and colleagues; present at
meetings and conferences, etc. It is also good practice to check in with those providing OER support
at your institution to see if there are local suggestions or requirements for sharing.
