If you're an educator, you may know that you can sometimes use copyrighted works in your
course through a principle known as fair use
([learn more from Oregon State University's copyright guide](https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/copyright/fairuse)).
In the U.S., whether or not something might be defended as fair use in court hinges on
four factors:

1.  The purpose of the use (transformative, non-profit, and educational uses may be more
allowable),
2.  The nature of the work,
3.  The amount taken,
4.  The impact on the market for the original.

When an educator makes 12 copies of a newspaper article for their class, this is unlikely
to have a large impact on the market for the _New York Times_. The same educator might want
to exercise more caution when distributing a copyrighted article in an open course they
create because of the fourth factor: since
[open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
are available to everyone, sharing copyrighted content widely could impact the market.

When possible, it’s best to find a replacement for copyrighted materials when creating
open educational resources. Find a similar article that’s open access, link to the article
rather than reproducing it, or include a citation rather than the full text. If you want
to use a copyrighted image, see if there's a similar one that has a Creative Commons
license, or make your own! This may seem like a lot of work, but it protects you and your
institution, and it will also make your open educational resources more useful to others
down the line.

Fair use exists because sometimes it is impossible to make these types of substitutions.
If it's necessary to use a very small piece of someone else’s work to make a point (a
short quote, for example), this is usually allowable. If you do this, be sure to indicate
that the content you're using is in copyright and you’re relying on fair use in your
attribution. Re-users of your open educational resources will need to make their own fair
use determination for that content.

Media and Social Impact's
