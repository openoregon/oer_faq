Some open textbooks come with ancillary materials like quizzes,
slides, instructor materials, homework platforms etc. Look around
on the page hosting the open textbook for links to instructor
resources.

These may be free, openly licensed materials, or hosted
independently and offered to students at an additional cost.

Some ancillaries can be integrated into a course management
system. Your institution may offer technology support to
instructors seeking to integrate these materials into
learning management systems.

This type of content is available through a variety of
repostitories. Here are a few places to search:

- Search or browse the Open Oregon Resources page for courses
where the instructor has specified that
[ancillaries are available](http://openoregon.org/resources/?ancillaries=yes)
either via link or by email request.
- [OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/) offers a facet to
narrow your search by material type. Enter your search term and
education level, hit search, and then explore the menu on the
left side of the search results page.
- For OpenStax textbooks, visit their
[OER Commons Hub](https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/OpenStax)
or look for the Instructor Resources link on the textbook
page (see image below).

If ancillary materials don't yet exist for the resource
that you plan to use, consider creating and sharing your own.
