Using [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
doesn't inherently bring more diverse perspectives to your course materials. Just because a
text is openly licensed does not ensure that it was created through an equity lens.

That said, instructors who adopt or create openly licensed materials can tailor the content
to their learning objectives and student needs, bringing in relevant perspectives for their
communities. Examples of bringing more diversity into course materials include translating
into different languages, including images/examples of diverse people, and using open
pedagogy to incorporate student voices and student work.
