Students are key advocates for open education. Their experiences with textbook prices often motivate faculty to look at
low-cost and open alternatives. Here are a few sources for student perspectives:

- Student-led social media campaigns such as #textbookbroke highlight the choices that students have to make in order
to balance their budgets.
- The Open Education Network curates a YouTube playlist of
[student-voice videos on textbook costs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWRE6ioG4vdZjdQ_R475jBKmWCXJQ4psq).
- Florida Virtual Campus surveyed over 20,000 students about the impact of textbook prices on their grades, academic
progress, and experience:
