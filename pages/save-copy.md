One of the great things about
[open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
is that you can save and retain copies without copyright limitations (because of the
permissions of the open license). It is always a good idea to save a copy to make sure
you always have access to these materials. Otherwise, the third-party site hosting your
course materials will inevitably crash at the worst possible moment for your students.

1.  Look for an option to download the content in a file format that you can save
(like a PDF or EPUB).
2.  Save this copy locally to your computer, Google Drive, a thumb drive, etc.
3.  You can now edit this version and upload it to your learning management system or
course site.

Never lose access to your course materials!
