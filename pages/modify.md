Instructors can adapt
[open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
to fit their learning objectives and their students' needs. The
[open license](http://faq.openoregon.org/about-open-licenses) gives you advance
permission to make changes, and share your new version, unless the license specifies
that no derivatives are allowed (in this case, you probably have a good
[fair use](http://faq.openoregon.org/fair-use) justification to modify the open
materials, but not share them beyond your own classroom).

When you use open content or work from the
[public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain), you must create an
attribution statement to acknowledge the source of the work (and make it easy to
find again). The easiest way to do this is with Open Washington's
[Open Attribution Builder](http://www.openwa.org/open-attrib-builder/).

For step-by-step instructions on importing and editing common open textbook file and
platform types, see the guide
[Modifying an Open Textbook: What You Need to Know](https://press.rebus.community/otnmodify/).
