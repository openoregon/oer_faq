Open educational practices are pedagogical strategies that use the affordances of open licenses to get
students involved in creative activities with real-world audiences. David Wiley is credited with coining
the term [open pedagogy](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/2975) and contrasts this type of assessment
with "disposable assignments" that have no value once a grade is assigned. Open pedagogy seeks to make
teaching materials and student learning both open and meaningful.
