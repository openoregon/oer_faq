You can find content with an open license or that is in the public domain in
many different places. Mostly resources that you'll want to find for your
course will be grouped by format. Open textbooks have a library, open images
live in image databases, open videos are on video sites, and so on.

Why isn't there one single repository for all
[open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources),
like a Google for searching open content? Because people are constantly
posting things on the web with all kinds of licensing terms and it's not
possible to catalog the web. The best we can do is keep in mind a few good
places to search for usable content - because you really don't need a
Google's-worth of material for your course, you just need enough material
to support students in meeting your learning objectives.

If you're getting stuck with search, ask a librarian!

## Recommended places to search for open educational resources


### Textbooks

[Open Textbook Library](http://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/) is a
collection of openly licensed full textbooks. Many are also peer reviewed.

### All types of open content

[OER Commons](https://www.oercommons.org/) is a repository for open
content in many different formats - whole courses, textbooks, videos,
handouts, modules, and more. On the search page you can use the
drop-down menu to filter your search results by education level, and
the results page has even more filters. Some of the content has been
reviewed.

### Images

[Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and
[Google Images](https://images.google.com/) both have a drop-down menu
in their search results to filter by creative commons license. For
lots more open image repositories, visit
[Open Images](http://faq.openoregon.org/open-images).

### Recommendations from other Oregon faculty

The [Open Oregon Resources page](http://openoregon.org/resources/)
has links to content that other Oregon community college instructors
are using in their courses. Note: this is a mix of copyright and open
content, so double-check before using. Unless you see an open license,
it's under traditional copyright.

### Curated lists of OER by subject

[Tacoma Community College](https://tacomacc.libguides.com/sb.php?subject_id=166458)
and [BC Campus](https://opentextbc.ca/oerdiscipline/) maintain curated
lists of open educational resources by subject and discipline.

### OER search engines

[OASIS](https://oasis.geneseo.edu/) and
[Mason OER Metafinder](https://oer.deepwebaccess.com/oer/desktop/en/search.html)
are two search tools that enable you to search across multiple OER
collections at once.
