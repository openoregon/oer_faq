There are some questions that can only be answered by someone at your own institution.
Here are a few examples of topics to seek local help with:

*   Faculty contracts, who owns work that you create
*   Getting your no-cost/low-cost course designated in the course schedule 
*   Availability of library resources as course materials
*   Accommodations for students with disabilities
