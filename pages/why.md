One reason that faculty choose to use [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources)
is the benefit to students in saving on textbook costs. Here are a few resources on the impact of saving money for students:

- [Covering the Cost: Why We Can No Longer Afford to Ignore High Textbook Prices](https://studentpirgs.org/2016/02/03/covering-cost/)
- [Four years and falling: Impact of statewide funding for textbook affordability](https://openoregon.org/four-years-and-falling/)
and [What is the cost of course materials for a four-year degree at each university in Oregon?](https://openoregon.org/what-is-the-cost-of-course-materials-for-a-four-year-degree-at-each-university-in-oregon/)
- [OER Adoption Impact Calculator](https://impact.lumenlearning.com/)

Faculty report that they benefit from being able to customize the course materials due to the affordance of the open license.
Here are a few examples:

- [Grant Project Update: ENVS 171 at Oregon Coast Community College](http://openoregon.org/envs-171-at-oregon-coast-community-college/)

- [Rating the Quality of Open Textbooks: How Reviewer and Text Characteristics Predict Ratings](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2985/4217)

Last, emerging research shows that student grades are likely to improve with the use of open educational resources
(probably because everyone has Day 1 access) and that the positive impact may be greater for traditionally underserved students,
such as Pell grant, non-White, and part-time students:
