Creative Commons licenses are the most popular form of licensing for OER
because they're easy to create and understand. Use the
[Chooser Tool](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) on the
Creative Commons website to specify
[the conditions](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
you'd like to share your work under and get a license you can copy and
paste into your document or embed in your web resource.
