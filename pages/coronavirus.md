Everybody switched to remote learning in Spring 2020 in a huge hurry and that created strong fair
use arguments for using copyrighted content in ways that might not ordinarily make sense. However,
it's more sustainable to stick with tried-and-true copyright practices in your online course, in
order to avoid extra work in the future.

## Who can give copyright advice?

-   Librarians can give advice but are not lawyers
-   Your institution may have a copyright officer
-   Your institution may have a copyright site (example:
[https://guides.pcc.edu/copyright](https://guides.pcc.edu/copyright))

## What can you share with students?

-   You can share open educational resources (or works in the public domain).
-   You can link out to freely available online resources that aren’t openly licensed.
-   You likely have a good fair use argument for sharing all-rights-reserved materials with
students online in a restricted setting - for example, in your learning management system which
is behind a password. More info: [https://tinyurl.com/tvnty3a](https://tinyurl.com/tvnty3a)
-   You can give your students a persistent, proxied link to resources in the libraries'
databases - ask a librarian if you need help.

## Open educational resources

-   Open licenses are added by the copyright holder and give permission in advance for the kinds
of use that we need for teaching and learning: to download and save a local copy, make revisions,
and share widely, without violating copyright.
-   [Open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) are
available for free online or in print at low cost. If a bound copy isn’t already available for
purchase, upload a pdf to [https://www.lulu.com/](https://www.lulu.com/) so that students can order
copies. Let the bookstore know the course materials you plan to adopt.
-   [Open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) can be
made fully accessible. More info in
[PCC's Accessibility Handbook](https://www.pcc.edu/instructional-support/accessibility/handbook/)
and from the accessibility services department at your own institution.

Long story short: if you redesign your course now with openly licensed materials (or content in
the public domain) you will not need to re-re-design later. More sustainable!
