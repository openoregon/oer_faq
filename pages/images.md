If you plan to share your work beyond your classroom with an open license, then everything in your course, including the images in your textbook or slideshows, must be:

1.  Content that you created yourself that has an [open license](http://faq.openoregon.org/about-open-licenses) on it;
2.  Content that someone else created that has an open license on it (or is in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain)).

## Sharing your image

There will probably be two more steps before your image is ready to share widely:

1.  Add an [attribution statement](http://faq.openoregon.org/open-content-attributions)
with the creator, title, link, and license information for the work;
2.  Add alt text to the image metadata so that the image can be understood by
screen reader users.
