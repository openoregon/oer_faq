This guide provides a method for writing attributions along with examples for different content types. We also recommend using the [Washington Open Attribution Builder](http://www.openwa.org/attrib-builder/) to get started. The attribution builder, and the examples here, provide attribution statements that you can copy and paste into your own document. You can then modify to include:

*   Where you used the content in your work
*   Any modifications you made to the content
*   License details

Help Other People Attribute You
===============================

Include a licensing statement to identify your original work and help downstream users write their attribution.

It is best practice to link to the Creative Commons license you are using in your attributions and licensing statements. Copy/paste from the list below.

[CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)

[CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)

[CC BY-ND 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0)

Original work

Revised work
------------

Overview by Christina Belli, Terese Jones, and Esmerelda Janeth Julyan is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). Revised by Terese Jones.

_It is up to the team to decide who gets credit, who is credited first, etc. You may also decide to just add the Revising Author name to the original list of authors._

Original section with a different license than overall work
-----------------------------------------------------------

Feminist Theory by Jennifer Puentes is licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

_The author chose this license for this chapter section because re-used text in this section had this same Sharealike license. If you use only a paragraph or so of the more restrictive (SA) licensed content, consider paraphrasing or using other content so that you can choose your own license._

Simple text table
-----------------

Figure 7.12. Student Enrollment by Race/Ethnicity over Time (2011-2020) Annual Headcount. Data from [Uni Headcount by Race](https://www.oregon.gov/highered/research/Documents/Student/Uni-Headcount-by-race.pdf), [Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission](https://www.oregon.gov/highered/Pages/index.aspx).

_Simple text tables are often not creative enough to be copyrightable (when they're just presenting numerical data, for example). While it is recommended to create attributions or licensing statements for most figures, original text tables do not need to be credited separately from the rest of the section. You can choose to credit yourself, though. Its a best practice to note where you got the data, if it is not original._

Organizing Attributions and Licensing Statements
================================================

While you're working on your text, add attribution statements in the order in which they appear. Don't worry about organizing them as you go along. When you're preparing a final draft, you may decide to group attributions and licensing statements into three categories with headings, to make them easier for downstream users to navigate:

*   Open Content, Original
*   Open Content, Shared Previously
*   All Rights Reserved Content

Example of Licenses & Attribution Section
-----------------------------------------

Below is an example of a Licenses and Attribution section (from the _Social Problems_ manuscript by Kimberly Puttman, with chapter author Kathryn Burrows), which is found at the end of each H2 section. Kimberly made the decision to include quotation marks around untitled descriptions of resources as well as titles. Make sure everyone on your team is aware of customizations to the default style for your book!
