Open Washington has a very helpful
[Open Attribution Builder](http://www.openwa.org/attrib-builder/)
to help create attributions for the openly licensed materials that
you reuse. Fill out the form and copy+paste the attribution into
your own document. Make sure to place the attribution in the same
place as the work you're reusing so that readers know you're
crediting the original creator!

Sample attribution for an openly licensed image:
["Creative Commons Licenses Infographic"](https://flic.kr/p/SP2J3y)
by [ricardo56](https://www.flickr.com/photos/48305871@N00/) is
licensed under
[CC BY-SA 2.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)

For more examples of good and not-so-good attribution statements, see
[Best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution)
on the Creative Commons Wiki.

## Citations vs Attributions

Citation and attribution are similar concepts in that they both
aim to give credit to others. Citations give credit when you use
someone else's ideas or words in your own work. Attributions give
credit when you reuse or reproduce someone else's openly licensed
work. While citations help you avoid plagiarism, attributions
fulfil a legal requirement.
