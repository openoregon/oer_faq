If you need to use items that are not openly licensed, and you plan to widely share your course beyond your classroom
or the learning management system, it is best practice to obtain permission from the author or copyright holder for the
specific use that you intend. It is also possible to determine whether your use without permission would be
[fair use](http://faq.openoregon.org/fair-use), and a librarian can help you do this analysis.

The good news is that many educators who post their work online want it to be reused and may be receptive to a request
that they add an open license to their copyright statement so that anyone else can reuse their work without asking
permission first in the future.

Authors may also choose to retain all-rights-reserved copyright to their work, or leave in place a more restrictive open
license, while giving you specific permission to reuse their content under a less restrictive open license. More
restrictively-licensed or “all rights reserved” content can be used for images, excerpts, and other content that can be
used as-is and attributed separately from the rest of the work. If you plan to blend the content with your own content
or other openly licensed content, you will need to
[consider license compatibility](https://openoregon.org/remixing-open-sources-with-conflicting-licenses/).

The overall goal is to consider downstream users of your course. Will future instructors be able to make the same use of
the copyrighted content if they decide to reuse your materials, or will they have to hunt down a replacement that is open
or in the public domain before they can adopt your course? Try to make things simple for the next person.

Below is a sample permission request email.
