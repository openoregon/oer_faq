Lowering the cost of course materials will have an impact on the campus store. However, Oregon's
bookstore managers are committed to student success and want to find a solution to the problem of
unaffordable textbooks.

You may have heard that lower bookstore revenue could hurt your institution's bottom line. It's
true that some campus stores contribute a percentage of their profit to the general fund. However,
artificially high textbook prices are not a sustainable way to support the general fund (and most
revenue from commercial textbook sales goes back to the publisher rather than the bookstore or the
general fund anyhow).

Faculty can help by letting the campus store know right away when they change their course materials
adoption, so that the bookstore manager doesn't stock textbooks that will not be used.

## Print

Campus stores are already the experts on print copies. Your bookstore manager can help you with
getting student access to print:

-   Ready-made copies (OpenStax model)
-   Print on demand (interior PDF and cover available)
-   Print from scratch
-   Fulfill online orders

## Policy

Campus stores help institutions comply with federal, state, and local policies.

-   Federal: Higher Education Opportunity Act requires reporting on cost of attendance, including
course materials.
-   State: HB 2871 in Oregon mandates that no-cost and low-cost course materials be designated in
the schedule.
-   Campus: e.g. tracking and stocking default adoptions

## Data

Campus stores can provide a wealth of data to help instituions better understand faculty and student
choices. What materials are being used? Which courses don’t require a purchase? Which materials aren't
being purchased? OER leaders on campus can collaborate with bookstore managers to answer these
questions and more.
